      <p>
        When we realized that big chain pharmacies were getting busy to the
        point where it became difficult for them to provide personalized 1-on-1
        patient care and consultation, we decided to create a platform for the
        community where personal care and health education was the number 1
        priority of ours. The term 1230 came into existence from the idea of
        "123". 123 stands for a simplified step-by-step process to create the
        best possible resolution for patient concerns in the shortest possible
        duration.

        When we thought of growing areas of Edmonton, the SW area of Edmonton
        came to our mind. The area has and continues to grow into a place of
        warmth and togetherness that we wanted to be a part of. It has been a
        wonderful journey to connect and grow alongside . Being located here
        could not have been more perfect!
      </p>

        We work hard to deliver the same level of patient care and customer
        service consistently while maintaining accuracy and precision of our
        patient care process. Maybe that will be noticed one day by the
        community for us to be distinguished from other pharmacies.
