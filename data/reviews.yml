    It is a great pharmacy. Employees were fast and efficient and very kind
    and understanding. The manager/owner is an amazing person and is a great
    role model for employees to look up too. My experience their was second
    to none and I highly recommend this pharmacy to anyone reading this.

    Super friendly staff. Very organized and clean. After finding out they were
    accepting walk ins for covid-19 vaccine from calling to getting there to
    getting my shot, I was in and out within 15 minutes. Thank you!

    organized with respect to Covid 19 guidelines.
