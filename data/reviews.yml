    Very clean and professional building. Amit was excellent and helped put
    our family at ease as he administered our vaccines. The staff is very patient,
    empathetic, knowledgeable and friendly. We appreciated the time they took to
    explain things to us both over the phone and in person. We are very happy with
    the experience we had with this team of professionals.

    Very friendly and professional, they answered all of my questions over the
    phone. Took the time to explain things to me, they didn't try to rush through
    the conversation, and didn't make me wait on hold for more than a few moments.

    I'm happy to see a new Pharmacy in this location, and I'm very excited to
    visit and receive my vaccination! Big thumbs up so far!

    It is a great pharmacy. Employees were fast and efficient and very kind
    and understanding. The manager/owner is an amazing person and is a great
    role model for employees to look up too. My experience their was second
    to none and I highly recommend this pharmacy to anyone reading this.

    Their customer service is excellent. The pharmacists explained everything
    in detail in a very friendly and comfortable way. The center is well
    organized with respect to Covid 19 guidelines.
